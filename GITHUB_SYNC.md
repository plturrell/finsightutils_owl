# GitHub Synchronization Guide

To sync your local OWL project to GitHub:

1. Create a new GitHub repository at https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: OWL
   - Description: OWL Converter for SAP HANA schemas with NVIDIA GPU acceleration
   - Set as Public or Private based on your needs
   - Initialize without README, .gitignore, or license (since we already have these)

2. Add the GitHub repository as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/OWL.git
   ```

3. Push your local repository to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. Verify the synchronization by visiting your GitHub repository URL.

## Repository Structure

The repository has been organized into a clean, production-ready structure:

- `config/`: Configuration files for Docker, Nginx, Prometheus, etc.
- `docs/`: Documentation organized by topic
- `scripts/`: Utility and deployment scripts
- `src/`: Source code organized as a proper Python package
- `tests/`: Test suite for verifying functionality

## NVIDIA T4 Deployment

To deploy with NVIDIA T4 GPU optimization:

1. Ensure you have:
   - NVIDIA T4 GPU (or compatible)
   - NVIDIA drivers installed
   - NVIDIA Container Toolkit installed
   - Docker and Docker Compose

2. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy_t4_optimized.sh
   ```

3. To test GPU capabilities before deployment:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy_t4_optimized.sh --test
   ```

4. Monitor the deployment through:
   - Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
   - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
   - GPU metrics: `nvidia-smi dmon -s u`

## Next Steps

After GitHub synchronization:

1. Set up CI/CD pipelines in GitHub Actions
2. Configure automated testing
3. Implement deployment environments (dev, staging, production)
4. Set up branch protection rules
