# NVIDIA Blueprint Update Notes

## Summary of Changes (June 8, 2025)

This update includes several important changes to the NVIDIA blueprint configuration to improve reliability, security, and functionality:

1. **Redis Authentication**:
   - Added Redis password authentication to both API and worker services
   - Ensured Redis password is properly passed via environment variable
   - This prevents unauthorized access to the Redis instance

2. **NGINX Health Check Improvement**:
   - Updated NGINX health check to use the `/api/v1/health` endpoint
   - This provides a more reliable check that verifies the API is actually functional
   - Changed port configuration to match current implementation

3. **API Testing**:
   - Added API_TEST_RESULTS.md with detailed documentation of successful endpoint tests
   - Verified that all core API endpoints are functioning correctly
   - Document processing, task management, and result retrieval all working as expected

## Installation & Deployment

No changes to the deployment process are required. The system can be deployed using the same commands as before:

```bash
# Deploy the system
./deploy.sh

# Verify the deployment
./verify-deployment.sh
```

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the Redis authentication implementation to ensure it doesn't impact performance
2. Consider implementing the missing endpoints identified in API_TEST_RESULTS.md for production
3. Set up continuous testing to regularly verify API functionality
4. Deploy to the NVIDIA server environment with GPU acceleration enabled
